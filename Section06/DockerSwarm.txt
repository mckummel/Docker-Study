Verify swarm status:

-   docker info

To start docker swarm:

-   docker swarm init

To view nodes:

-   docker node ls

Starting an image:

-   docker service create alpine ping 8.8.8.8

To view services:

-   docker service ls

Changing the number of replicas:

-   docker service update <id> --replicas <number>

If I remove a replica using:

- docker container rm -f <id>

docker will launch a new replica to replace the one that was removed/failed.
-------------------------------------

We can only have one node leader at a time amongst the managers.
