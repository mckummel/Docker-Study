To find docker images:

https://hub.docker.com/explore/

An image is the applications binaries and dependencies and how to run it.
    "Made up of a series of file system changes and metadata"
We can have our app binaries as images... or Ubuntu, Apache, mongodb, mysql, node...

It's possible to find a lot about official images on docker hub. 
On docker hub there are non-official images... (made by anyone)

We can download different versions of an image using different tags (when we are going to download it):
    stable, latest, alpine, 1.11(version numbers), 1
    The same version can have more than one tag: lastest, (version number), 10, 10.0, 10.0.0

If we run two containers of a single image, what's actually happnening
it's that container 1 and 2 would be the difference between what's happening running and what's in on the image

To see "parts" of an image:

docker history <image>

To see metadata of an image:

docker image inspect <image>

------------------------------------

latest is generally the newest version available, and it's also the default used

------------------------------------

It's possible to upload an image to my repository using:

docker login 
    Must be logged in to upload the image

docker image push <id/>

docker logout
